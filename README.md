# Task3 User Manual (Palindrome Checker)


## Introduction

The Palindrome Checker is a simple Python program made to determine whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. 

### What's a palindrome?

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces and capitalisation). Examples include "madam", "racecar", and "ka yak"

This program processes the input, removes spaces, converts all characters to lowercase and checks if the string matches its reverse.
